# Introduction
Hello, my name is Ankeraout, welcome to my profile!
You will find here a list of interesting projects that I made.
These projects have one thing in common: I did them not for innovation, but for learning purposes.
[Richard Feynman](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) once said "What I cannot create, I do not understand".
This is my philosophy of life.

I worked on these projects with a lot of excitement for learning new stuff.

I earned skills from every single one of these projects, and these are only the public ones.
There are a lot of projects that I worked on, that I simply deleted.

Note that some projects are not finished, because some of these projects require a quantity of time that I simply cannot allocate to them.
